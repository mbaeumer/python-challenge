In 2017, I started earning Python in my spare time. This repository contains a bunch of samples and exercises covering various topics:
1. Data types and how to handle them
2. control flow (if-clause, loops)
3. Object-oriented programming
4. Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
5. testing
6. file operations and different file IO
7. numpy examples
8. sorting algorithms
9. various small exercises and simple "first year solutions"
